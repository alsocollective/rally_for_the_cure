				<p>PILOTS TAKE TO THE AIR AND DRIVERS TO THE ROAD TO RAISE FUNDS FOR CANCER RESEARCH
				</p>
				<p>On Sunday September 14, 2014 The Ewings Cancer Foundation of Canada (ECFC) will host its 5th Annual Rally for the Cure, a charity fundraising event featuring an Air and Car Rally with a treasure hunt theme.  The Car Rally will take place throughout the York Region as the Air Rally takes place simultaneously from six participating Municipal Airports.
				</p>
				<p>The Rally is followed by an enjoyable afternoon at Buttonville Airport that includes an M&amp;M “special menu” BBQ lunch, a sensational silent auction, live musical entertainment featuring The Emma Street Band and Glenn Reid &amp; Boogaloo with an awards ceremony and Citytv’s own BT personality Frank Ferragine as the event MC.</p>
				<p>All proceeds from this event go directly to The Ewings Cancer Foundation of Canada to support Ewing sarcoma specific research grants.</p>
				<p>Ewing sarcoma occurs most often in 10-20 year olds but can happen at any age and is the second most common bone cancer. Ewing sarcoma is a highly aggressive cancer that often goes undiagnosed or is mistaken as growing pains or a sports injury.If metastases has occurred, the chance of cure is less than 20%.</p>
				<p>Tina Pernica, Founder of the ECFC, speaks about her son, Reid, a young pilot who lost his battle with this disease in November 2007.  He was 19 years old.</p>
				<p>“It was always Reid’s dream to become a pilot.  He was able to fulfill that dream while working at Buttonville Airport and taking flying lessons. He made his first solo flight just months before his cancer, then in remission, returned.  The wings in our logo symbolize Reid’s dream of flight.”</p>
				<p>“Our loss of Reid to Ewing sarcoma was devastating.” Tina attests. “It was infuriating to learn how little research has been completed since its discovery in the 1920s. How can physicians treat the disease without greater understanding?”</p>
				<p>“Most importantly, we want the children and young adults affected by this disease to ultimately reap the benefits of this research,” Tina emphasizes, “and to have the opportunity to look forward to living long lives spent fulfilling their dreams.”</p>
